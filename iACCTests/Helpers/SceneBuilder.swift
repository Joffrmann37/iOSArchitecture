/// This SceneBuilder test helper provides a simple way of injecting global dependencies into legacy codebases
/// and resetting them back to prevent a test from influencing the result of the next test. It lets you inject all global
/// dependencies such as time zone, locale, cache, and API services. Moreover, it wraps the root view controller
/// into a `ContainerViewControllerSpy` to enable testing modal view controller presentations in a fast and reliable way.
///
/// ---
///
/// When dealing with legacy code, you usually will have to replace global dependencies
/// with test doubles to enable testability without using slow and fragile components
/// such as network requests.
///
/// Replacing global dependencies is not ideal because changing global state can affect multiple
/// parts of the system at once, leading to slow and fragile tests.
///
/// Moreover, replacing global dependencies will prevent running tests in parallel
/// (because replacing the dependency for one test would affect other tests running in parallel!).
///
/// But it's a simple way to start testing legacy code until you can inject the dependencies
/// with proper Dependency Injection patterns.
///
/// So to make this legacy project realistic, we kept the global dependencies to show how you
/// can start testing components without making massive changes to the project.
